                    First task is to set up the objective that must drive the brain of our F1. In this exercise, the target is
                    to follow the red line drawn in the middle of the circuit's road. To achieve this objective we will try to
                    maintain this red line as much in the center of the screen as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So first, we need to extract the red line from our robot vision system. This is a simple task, as
                    we don't have to deal with illumination conditions or dealing with other red objects in the view, thanks
                    to our simplified environment. A color masking in HSV color space, searching for red color, and a couple
                    erosion and dilation operations leave us with a pretty decent mask of the line.

                <p>
                    Next step, it's time to detect when whe are out of the center of the line. We assume that the horizontal
                    central point of the line should be centered at the horizontal central point of the screen. To have a better response,
                    and anticipate earlier to curves, we've chosen to use the central point at the upper side of the
                    line. To have a second measure of displacement, we have chosen to get a second central point in the middle
                    vertical position of the line just in case we need it later. For these points we can calculate how much are
                    they displaced from the horizontal center of the screen.

                <p>
                    Now that we have got the vision system of our car working, and we know how far the car is from the central
                    line, it's time to control it by steering and accelerating accordingly. The task in the exercise is to
                    achieve this by implementing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">PID controller</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>P Controller: <p>The Proportional controller just gets proportional to the error obtained from the vision system.
                            <br />In our implementation: <strong>P = error</strong></p></li>
                        <li>I Controller: <p>The Integral controller integrates de amount of error over time, so if the I controller
                        takes much time or is no enough to get error to zero, this terms augments and forces it. <br/>In out implementation:
                        <strong>I = I + error * delta_time</strong></p></li>
                        <li>D Controller: <p>The Derivative controller calculates the rate of change of the error, by calculating the derivative of error over time.
                        <br />In our discrete implementation: <strong>D=(error - previous_error) / delta_time</strong></p></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The three controllers are integrated to choose how much do we have to steer to return the F1 to it's
                    path following the line. Three constants <strong>Kp, Ki and Kd</strong> respectively tune the amount of
                    each of the controllers involved in the final response.
                    The final PID returned in our implementation: <strong>PDI = Kp * P + Kd * d + Ki * I</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, to avoid peaks when the values go too high, we apply a low pass filter to the result of the
                    PID controller. This low pass filter keeps the absolute value of the controller between 0.0 and 4.0, or the
                    value between -4.0 and 4.0.

                <p>
                    This has been probably the hardest and trickiest part of the exercise. Tuning the parameters of the
                    PID controller has supposed to do a lot of trial and error tests on the simulator.
                    We've started by running a lap at low speed [<strong>V=4</strong>] and see what happens.

                                First attempt with only a Proportional controller. Using a value of [<strong>Kp=2.0]</strong>]
                                for the Proportional controller and [<strong>Kd=0.0</strong>], [<strong>Ki=0.0</strong>]
                                for the other two, Integral and Derivative controllers, we achieved to perform a full lap without
                                crashes, but the car drifted away from the line a little bit in curves so the value of
                                the Proportional controller wasn't enough to keep the car over the red line during all lap.

                                So the obvious reaction is to increase the weight of the Proportional controller. Trying a
                                value of [<strong>Kp=5.0</strong>] makes the controller overreact in curves, and makes
                                it start to oscillate. This oscillations go very high, only limited by the low pass
                                filter of the PID controller.

                                With this effect in mind, we get to a compromise value for the weight of the Proportional
                                controller. This value is [<strong>Kp=3.5</strong>] and it keeps the car centered in the
                                line with no or almost no oscillations. At this speed we complete the test course in about 1:52.

                <h4>Tuning at high speed</h4>
                <p>
                    Now that we have the controller performing well at low speeds, it's time to go for high speed
                    rates. To start our high speed test, we double the speed [<strong>V=8</strong>] and try our previous
                    low speed setup to see how it performs now.
                </p>

                                Still we are using only the Proportional controller, with same weight [<strong>Kp=3.5</strong>]
                                and [<strong>Ki=0.0</strong>], [<strong>Kd=0.0</strong>]. At this speed, the car drifts away a
                                lot more, mostly at curve start, but there is not much bouncing and it gets back to the line
                                pretty quickly. So we get again to complete the lap and this time we do it is less than one minute.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During the tests, a lot, we have done at this speed, we realize that there is not much
                                more we can do by keeping a P controller only. Higher values lead to bounce too much and crash,
                                smaller values lead to not enough steering and crash too.

                                Now we start tuning the Differential controller. Increasing the value step by step we
                                have realized that we can react stronger to curves without bouncing. That has allowed us to
                                move up the Proportional controller weight to [<strong>Kp=5.0</strong>] and tested different
                                values for the Differential controller weight. By testing we have calculated that a value
                                between 6.0 and 7.0 for the differential controller performs quite well, the final value
                                we have chosen is [<strong>Kd=6.5</strong>].

                                As a side effect, by keeping the car centered in the line and avoiding bouncing we have
                                reduced the lap time by a couple seconds.

                            Now it's time to verify if this high speed controller works fine in the other courses.
                            Again we have tested it in Montreal and Montmelo circuits in the simulator, and it seems to
                            perform quite well on both of them, though we can see high bouncing in tricky curves of
                            both circuits.

                            In Montmelo circuit we have tested it's stability by performing several lapses, for a total
                            of more than ten, without a crash.

            <h3>Tunning car speed</h3>
            <div class="col-lg-12">
                <p>
                    For what we have seen so far, the steering controller performs quite well, but it fails more and more
                    as we increase speed in curves. It seems obvious that on the other side we can increase speed a lot
                    in straight areas. Therefor we need to slow down in curves and speed up in straights.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- FIRST TEST RUN -->
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <div class="col-lg-6">
                        <p>
                            The approach we decided to use to increase car speed in straights while lowering it down
                            in curves was to model speed with a function that reacts inverse to steering. When steering
                            reaches 0 we want to go at fastest speed, while when steering increases we want to lower the
                            speed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We decided to model this with a gaussian function centered in 0, where it should reach it's
                            maximum value. We want it to decrease fast enough, but as gaussian value approaches value 0 when
                            it moves away from it's center, we have chosen to set a minimum value that we think we can handle
                            curves quite good. We decided this minimum value to be [<strong>V=8</strong>] and maximum
                            [<strong>V=15</strong>], so we modeled the speed as:
                            <pre class="prettyprint">
    v_e = pdi_controller.PDI * 1.5
    v = max(8.0, 15 * math.exp(-abs(v_e) ** 2))</pre>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We have experimented to get the best performing values we could find. The hardest challenge
                            is curve entrance, as we come at real fast speed, we have found the best performance
                            at [<strong>Kp=4.25</strong>], [<strong>Kd=5.75</strong>]. We couldn't find any improvemente by
                            using I controller, maybe due to our implementation, so we left [<strong>Ki=0.0</strong>].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With this variable speed we complete the test circuit in 39 seconds, nod bad. The car bounces
                            in the beginning of curves, but it recovers quite well and doesn't crash in this circuit.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Find the line: </strong>Look for the line if the simulation doesn't start aligned to it.

                    <li><strong>Incremental controller: </strong> Tune the incremental controller and use it to improve
                    performance</li>
                    <li><strong>Speed PID controller: </strong> So far the PID controller is implemented as a class, so it can
                    be reused. We will try to control speed using a PID controller, just to check if we can achieve a better performance</li>
